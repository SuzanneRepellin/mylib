# mylib
Basic functions inspired by libc and printf and designed to satisfy the needs of the programmer when using C.

The vast majority of the functions where coded during my first month of the 101 curriculum. A few changes have been made since, but some of them still deserve to be improved.

The get_next_line function was made during my second month at 101, as one single mandatory project.

The ft_printf functions that recreates some of the most useful features of the stdio printf was made during the third month of my curriculum.

This lib is made to be improved and extended in order to be as useful as possible for my projects at school and personnal projects.
